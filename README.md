## Overview

The project focuses on building a machine learning model to predict whether a loan application will be approved or rejected. The model is trained using a dataset from Kaggle, which includes features like applicant income, co-applicant income, loan amount, loan term, credit history, and more.

## Dataset

The dataset used for this project is available on Kaggle: [Loan Eligibility Prediction Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ninzaami/loan-predication)

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/loan-eligibility-prediction.git
    ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
    ```bash
    cd loan-eligibility-prediction
    ```

3. Install the required dependencies:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Usage

1. Open the Jupyter Notebook:
    ```bash
    jupyter notebook Loan_eligibility.ipynb
    ```

2. Run the cells in the notebook to preprocess the data, train the model, and make predictions.

3. Modify and experiment with different models and parameters to improve prediction accuracy.

## Results

The final model achieves an accuracy of XX% on the test set, indicating its effectiveness in predicting loan eligibility. The model can be further improved by fine-tuning the parameters and exploring additional features.
